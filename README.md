personal website

0. website title and header: a picture, a name, or something that summarizes the website 

1. nav bar:  home, resume, projects, photographs, contact
2. home: summary，selfie，links to social apps
3. resume: could be be.html or .pdf
4. projects: to be interactive, use database to add, modify, delete
5. photographs: add watermark
6. contact: form - send email
7. bottom bar: contact info
9. use **expressjs** as a server to deliver the website, but the website itself is more like a client-side product because it doesn't involve many interactions between the website and users
9. therefore use **bootstrap** to be responsive, and maybe **angularJs** to handle simple interactions
